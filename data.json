The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person. Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women and girls, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse. Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours. There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species � P. falciparum and P. vivax � pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa.

        "text": "People may experience different symptoms from COVID-19. Symptoms usually begin 5�6 days after exposure and last 1�14 days. The most common symptoms are: fever chills sore throat. Less common symptoms are: muscle aches and heavy      arms or legs severe fatigue or      tiredness runny or blocked nose,      or sneezing headache sore eyes dizziness new and persistent      cough tight chest or chest      pain shortness of breath hoarse voice numbness or tingling appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea loss or change of sense      of taste or smell difficulty sleeping. People with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical attention: difficulty breathing,      especially at rest, or unable to speak in sentences confusion drowsiness or loss of      consciousness persistent pain or      pressure in the chest skin being cold or      clammy, or turning pale or a bluish colour loss of speech or movement. People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include people taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer. obesity or dementia. People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms. These long-term effects are called long COVID (or post COVID-19 condition). The most common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity). Long COVID can affect a person�s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores."

        "text": "People should get vaccinated as soon as it�s their turn. They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: avoid crowds and keep a      safe distance from others, even if they don�t appear to be sick; wear a properly fitted      mask if you feel sick, have been close to people who are sick, if you are      at high-risk, or in crowded or poorly ventilated areas; clean your hands      frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; cover your mouth and      nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze; dispose of used tissues      right away and clean your hands; and if you develop symptoms      or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover. Vaccination against COVID-19 is based on priority groups such as people aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic health problems, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant persons, and unvaccinated people. In March 2023, WHO updated its recommendations on primary series vaccination (two doses of any vaccine) as well as the need for booster doses. These recommendations are time-limited and can change at any time depending on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is circulating in your area or country. It is important to stay up to date with local guidelines and recommendations provided by your local health authority. Since its introduction, COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives across the world by providing protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Even though vaccines protect against severe disease and death, it is still possible to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others after being vaccinated."

The Organization works with Member States and partners on all aspects of the pandemic response, including facilitating research, developing guidance, coordinating vaccine development and distribution, and monitoring daily case numbers and trends around the world. Since April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight a disease. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the ACT-Accelerator is a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO also leads work to improve global capacity and access to oxygen production, distribution and supply to patients. Although WHO announced the end of the emergency phase of COVID-19 in May 2023, the Organization continues to coordinate the global response."

        "heading": "Key facts",
        "text": "Rabies is a serious public health problem in over 150 countries and territories, mainly in Asia and Africa. It is a viral, zoonotic, neglected tropical disease that causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, with 40% being children under 15. Dog bites and scratches cause 99% of the human rabies cases, and can be prevented through dog vaccination and bite prevention. Once the virus infects the central nervous system and clinical symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in 100% of cases. However, rabies deaths are preventable with prompt post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) by stopping the virus from reaching the central nervous system. PEP consists of thorough wound washing, administration of a course of human rabies vaccine and, when indicated, rabies immunoglobulins (RIG). If a person is bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, they should immediately and always seek PEP care. WHO and its global partners aim to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through a comprehensive One Health approach promoting mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to PEP, health worker training, improved surveillance, and bite prevention through community awareness."

        "text": "The incubation period for rabies is typically 2�3 months but may vary from one week to one year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits. There are two forms of rabies: Furious rabies results in hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hallucinations, lack of coordination, hydrophobia (fear of water) and aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting from the wound site. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease."

        "text": "Currently there are no WHO-approved diagnostic tools for detecting rabies infection before the onset of clinical disease. Clinical diagnosis of rabies is difficult without a reliable history of contact with a rabid animal or specific symptoms of hydrophobia or aerophobia. Accurate risk assessment is crucial for deciding on PEP administration. Once symptoms emerge, and death is inevitable, offering comprehensive and compassionate palliative care is recommended. Postmortem confirmation of rabies infection is done by various diagnostic techniques that detect whole viruses, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin or saliva) (Laboratory techniques in rabies Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 ). Where possible, the biting animal should be tested."

Fewer doses also promote patient compliance with the recommended regimen."

This entails: improving access to human rabies vaccines through the efforts of the WHO and its partners, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which had included human rabies vaccines in its Vaccine Investment Strategy for 2021�2025. Despite pandemic-related delays, WHO now collaborates with Gavi to implement the program in 2024; providing technical guidance to countries in developing and implementing their national rabies elimination plans, focusing on strengthening surveillance and reporting; encouraging countries to build the capacity of their One Health workforce by using rabies elimination programs as a platform for multisectoral collaborations; and encouraging the use of United Against Rabies (UAR) multi-stakeholder forum , which was launched in collaboration with WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE), to advocate for action and investment in rabies control."
